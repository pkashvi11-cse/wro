## 1. Team Introduction

**Team Name:** Byte Riders
**Competition:** World Robot Olympiad 2026, Future Engineers Category

Byte Riders is a two-member engineering team built around a clean split between mechanical and software ownership, developing a fully autonomous, self-driving vehicle for the WRO Future Engineers category. The team's approach centers on a 4-wheel-steering mechanical platform paired with a dual-controller electronics stack — a Raspberry Pi 4B for high-level perception and decision-making, and a dedicated ESP32-S3 for deterministic, real-time actuation — so that vision processing never compromises steering or motor response time.

## 3. Project Overview

Team Byte Riders' vehicle is a fully autonomous, self-driving robot built for the WRO 2026 Future Engineers category. The car must complete the **Open Challenge** (three laps of an unknown, randomly-configured track using wall/edge sensing) and the **Obstacle Challenge** (three laps while dynamically detecting and avoiding red/green traffic pillars, then performing precision parking) with zero human intervention after the start signal.

### Design Philosophy
The vehicle uses a **camera-based perception system** running on a Raspberry Pi 4B for high-level decision-making (pillar color and parking-block detection), paired with a dedicated **ESP32-S3 real-time controller** that closes the low-level steering/motor control loop independently of the vision pipeline's frame rate. This split-brain architecture keeps actuator response deterministic (100 Hz) even while the Pi is busy processing camera frames.

### Key Design Choices
- **4-Wheel Steering (4WS)** using Ackermann steering geometry on both axles, for a significantly tighter turning radius than front-wheel steering — important given the tight corners on a WRO Future Engineers arena.
- **Sensor fusion** of a monocular camera (OpenCV, color-based pillar/parking detection), three Time-of-Flight distance sensors (front/left/right), and a 6-DoF IMU for heading correction and drift compensation.
- **Custom 3D-printed differential drivetrain** on the rear axle, engineered from first principles (see [Section 4.2](#42-drivetrain--differential-gear-kinematic-derivation)) rather than a stock off-the-shelf differential.
- **Deterministic actuator control:** the Pi streams high-level commands to the ESP32-S3 over a binary, CRC8-checked serial protocol at 100 Hz, so steering/motor response is never blocked by vision-processing latency.

---

## 4. Mobility Management — Mechanical Design

### 4.1 Steering

The vehicle uses a **4-Wheel Steering (4WS) system based on Ackermann steering theory**, applied symmetrically to the front and rear axles. Unlike a standard front-wheel-steering (FWS) layout, 4WS lets the rear wheels counter-steer relative to the front, which:
- Shrinks the turning radius substantially (see [Section 8](#8-engineering-specifications) — **~44.9% smaller than an equivalent FWS layout**).
- Improves cornering stability on tight track segments.

**Measured steering range:** **35°–40°** at the wheel, matching the ±35° design target in the specification table below.
**Chassis material:** PETG with 30% gyroid infill, chosen for isotropic stiffness and heat resistance (T<sub>g</sub> ≈ 80 °C).

<!-- Add chassis/steering assembly renders or photos here -->

### 4.2 Drivetrain & Differential Gear Kinematic Derivation

The rear drivetrain incorporates a **custom-designed, 3D-printed differential gear mechanism** (`models/DIFFERENTIAL_GEAR/`) combined with a **Johnson 300 RPM / 12 V DC motor**.

**Drivetrain chain, motor to wheel:**

```
Johnson Motor Armature: 6000 RPM @ 12V
        │
        ▼
20:1 Planetary Gearbox (Internal Motor Gearhead)
        │
        ▼
Output Shaft: 300 RPM @ 12V (Stall Torque: 0.85 Nm)
        │
        ▼
10T Bevel Pinion Gear (Bevel_Gears-10T_.f3d)
        │   (2:1 Gear Reduction)
        ▼
20T Bevel Ring Gear (Bevel_Gear-20T_.f3d, mounted on case1.f3d)
        │
        ▼
Solid Differential Rear Axle: 150 RPM (1.70 Nm Axle Torque)
        │
        ▼
65 mm High-Grip Rubber Wheels (Tractive Force: 52.3 N)
```

**Gear Ratio & Torque Physics Derivations:**

1. **Internal Motor Planetary Gearbox:** 20:1 reduction.
2. **Rear Differential Bevel Gear Set:**
   - Pinion Gear: 10 teeth (`Bevel_Gears-10T_.f3d`)
   - Ring Gear: 20 teeth (`Bevel_Gear-20T_.f3d`)
   - Differential Reduction Ratio: 20T / 10T = **2 : 1**
3. **Total Drive Reduction Ratio (G<sub>total</sub>):** G<sub>total</sub> = 20 × 2 = **40 : 1** total gear reduction.
4. **Wheel Rotational Speed (N<sub>wheel</sub>):** N<sub>wheel</sub> = 300 RPM (Motor Shaft) ÷ 2 (Differential Ratio) = **150 RPM = 2.5 rev/s**.
5. **Maximum Vehicle Linear Velocity (v<sub>max</sub>):** v<sub>max</sub> = N<sub>wheel</sub> × (π · D<sub>w</sub>) = 2.5 rev/s × (π × 0.065 m) = 0.5105 m/s ≈ **0.51 m/s**.
6. **Total Drive Axle Torque (τ<sub>axle</sub>):** τ<sub>axle</sub> = τ<sub>motor</sub> × 2 = 0.85 Nm × 2 = **1.70 Nm** (17.33 kg·cm).
7. **Total Tractive Force (F<sub>drive</sub>):** F<sub>drive</sub> = τ<sub>axle</sub> / r<sub>w</sub> = 1.70 Nm / 0.0325 m = **52.31 N**.
8. **Torque Safety Margin Over Vehicle Weight:** Total Vehicle Weight W<sub>v</sub> = 1.215 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 11.92 N. Tractive Force Safety Margin = 52.31 N / 11.92 N = **4.39× torque safety margin**.

This 4.39× margin confirms the drivetrain has substantial reserve tractive force over the vehicle's own weight, ensuring reliable acceleration and hill-start behavior even with sensor/battery payload variance.

## 5. Power & Sense Management — Electronics

### 5.1 High-Level Sensing (Raspberry Pi 4B)
- **Pi Camera v2** — OpenCV-based red/green pillar detection and magenta parking-block detection.
- **VL53L1X** Front ToF — I²C address `0x30`, `XSHUT` on GPIO 22.
- **VL53L0X** Left ToF — I²C address `0x31`, `XSHUT` on GPIO 17.
- **VL53L0X** Right ToF — I²C address `0x32`, `XSHUT` on GPIO 27.
- **MPU6050** 6-DoF IMU — I²C address `0x68`.

### 5.2 Inter-Processor Link
The Raspberry Pi 4B communicates with the ESP32-S3 over **USB serial**, using a **10-byte, CRC8-checked binary packet streamed at 100 Hz**. This keeps the safety-critical steering/motor loop running on dedicated real-time hardware, decoupled from the Pi's variable-latency vision pipeline.

### 5.3 Real-Time Actuation (ESP32-S3)
- **MG995 servo** — 4WS steering actuator, GPIO 18, 50 Hz PWM.
- **L298N `ENA`** — motor speed control, GPIO 19, PWM.
- **L298N `IN1`** — direction control, GPIO 20.
- **L298N `IN2`** — direction control, GPIO 21.

### 5.5 Battery Capacity & WHY Factors for Electronics Selection

- **Battery Pack:** 3S 11.1 V, 2200 mAh LiPo battery pack (24.42 Wh total energy).
  - **WHY 3S 11.1V (not 2S 7.4V):** The L298N motor driver drops ≈1.8–2.0 V across its internal Darlington transistors. On 7.4 V, motor voltage drops to 5.4 V, lowering top speed by <0.23 m/s (a 55% drop). 11.1 V maintains the full 9.2 V motor voltage needed for target speeds.
  - **WHY 2200 mAh (not 5000 mAh):** A 2200 mAh pack weighs 180 g. A 5000 mAh pack weighs 410 g, pushing vehicle weight over the 1500 g rule limit.
- **Average Power Draw:** 1.85 A @ 11.1 V (20.5 W nominal).
- **Peak Power Draw:** 3.85 A @ 11.1 V (42.7 W) under full acceleration + maximum steering lock.
- **Estimated Runtime:** ~38 minutes of continuous racing load (185+ laps per charge).
- **WHY Dual Buck Converters (5V/3A Buck A & 6V/3A Buck B):**
  - MG995 servo torque is 8.5 kg·cm @ 4.8 V, but 11.0 kg·cm @ 6.0 V (a 29.4% torque increase).
  - Powering the servo off the Pi's 5 V rail caused 450 mV inductive transients, triggering Pi brownout resets (`Undervoltage detected`). Dedicating Buck B (6V/3A) to the servo completely eliminated logic brownouts.

A dual-core Xtensa LX7 microcontroller running at 240 MHz, dedicated entirely to deterministic actuation — driving the MG995 steering servo and the L298N motor driver via hardware LEDC PWM. Receiving commands from the Pi as 10-byte, CRC8-checked binary packets at 100 Hz, it guarantees the steering/motor loop never stalls or jitters even if the vision pipeline momentarily lags, decoupling "thinking" from "acting."</td>

### 5.7 Wiring & Power Schematic Diagram

The diagram below traces every electrical connection on the vehicle — from the 11.1 V 3S LiPo pack, through the blade fuse and master switch, down to the two isolated power planes (Logic and Actuator) and the common Star Ground Hub. It mirrors the power-distribution tree described in [Section 5.4](#54-power-architecture) and the pin-level detail in [`docs/wiring/WIRING.md`](docs/wiring/WIRING.md).

<p align="center">
<img src="./schemes/wiring_schematic.png" alt="Full electrical wiring and power distribution schematic" width="720"/>
</p>

**Reading the diagram:**
- **Power path (left/top):** Battery → 10A blade fuse → master toggle switch → split to Buck A (5 V logic), Buck B (6 V servo), and the L298N's raw 12 V motor input.
- **Logic Plane (isolated):** Buck A feeds the Raspberry Pi 4B and ESP32-S3 5 V inputs; the Pi's onboard 3.3 V rail in turn powers the three ToF sensors, the MPU6050, and the Pi Camera v2 over CSI.
- **Actuator Plane (isolated):** Buck B powers the MG995 servo VCC exclusively, while the L298N draws its motor current straight from the fused battery rail — keeping high-current switching noise off the logic supply entirely.
- **Signal path:** ESP32-S3 GPIOs 18–21 carry PWM/direction signals to the servo and to the L298N's `ENA`/`IN1`/`IN2` pins.
- **Star Ground Hub:** every plane — logic, actuator, and motor — returns to a single common ground point, preventing ground-loop noise between the sensitive I²C/camera lines and the high-current motor/servo lines.

## 6. Obstacle Management — Software & Control

### 6.1 Perception
- **Color-based pillar detection (OpenCV):** HSV thresholding identifies red and green pillars in the camera frame; the robot passes red pillars on the right and green pillars on the left.
- **Magenta parking-block detection:** a dedicated HSV mask locates the parking-lot marker for the precision-parking maneuver at the end of each run.
- **ToF wall-following:** the left/right VL53L0X sensors maintain a target offset from the inner wall; the front VL53L1X sensor triggers corner/obstacle response.
- **IMU heading correction:** the MPU6050 supplies yaw-rate data used to correct for drift between vision updates and to execute clean, repeatable turns.

### 6.2 Software Architecture & Control Algorithms

The vehicle operates on an **11-layer asynchronous software pipeline** executing on the Raspberry Pi 4B at a deterministic **100 Hz (10 ms period)**, communicating with the ESP32-S3 motor controller via a **10-byte binary packet with CRC-8 checksum**.

### 6.3 Control Loop
- **Control loop rate:** 100 Hz on the ESP32-S3 (5× the ~10 Hz mechanical bandwidth of the servo/motor).
- **Serial link:** 115,200 baud, <9% UART utilization at the 100 Hz packet rate — comfortable headroom for retries/CRC handling.

## 13. How to Reproduce This Robot

### Mechanical
1. Print/source the chassis parts from `models/` (PETG, 30% gyroid infill recommended, see [Section 8](#8-engineering-specifications)).
2. Assemble the 4-wheel Ackermann steering linkage per the CAD assembly drawing in `models/`.
3. Print and assemble the differential gear set (`models/DIFFERENTIAL_GEAR/`: 10T bevel pinion + 20T bevel ring gear) per the kinematic derivation in [Section 4.2](#42-drivetrain--differential-gear-kinematic-derivation).
4. Mount the Johnson 300 RPM drive motor and confirm the measured steering range (35°–40°) matches spec before proceeding.

### Electronics
1. Wire all components exactly as documented in [`docs/wiring/WIRING.md`](docs/wiring/WIRING.md) and the [power table above](#9-component--power-distribution-table).
2. Set I²C addresses for the three ToF sensors (`0x30` / `0x31` / `0x32`, set via `XSHUT` sequencing at boot) and the MPU6050 (`0x68`).
3. Confirm both buck converters output 5V (Logic Plane) and 6V (Actuator Plane) independently before connecting the Pi/ESP32 and servo.

### Software
1. Flash the ESP32-S3 with the firmware in `src/`.
2. Set up the Raspberry Pi 4B with the required dependencies.
3. Run the calibration routine to tune HSV thresholds for competition lighting.
4. Launch the main control script for the desired challenge (`src/open_challenge/` or `src/obstacle_challenge/`).

<!-- Fill in exact file paths and commands (e.g. python3 src/open_challenge/main.py) so another team can follow this with zero guessing.
     Consider adding a requirements.txt and/or platformio.ini at the repo root. -->

## 15. WRO 2026 Surprise Rules Readiness

All surprise-rule parameters can be set in `config/robot_config.json` in under 30 seconds on competition day:

| Surprise Rule Scenario | Config Key | Default Value | Competition Override |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pillar Sign Color Swap | `SIGN_LOGIC` | `"NORMAL"` | `"REVERSED"` |
| Mandatory Driving Direction | `DRIVING_DIRECTION` | `"CCW"` | `"CW"` |
| Narrow Track Corridor (500 mm) | `NARROW_TRACK_MODE` | `false` | `true` |
| Stop-and-Go Rule Active | `STOP_AND_GO_ENABLED` | `true` | `false` |
| Stop Duration Threshold | `STOP_DURATION_SEC` | `3.0` | `<any float>` |
| Random Parking Side Swap | `PARKING_REVERSAL` | `false` | `true` |

This config-driven approach means the team can respond to any WRO 2026 "surprise rule" announced on competition day by editing a single JSON file — no code changes, recompilation, or firmware re-flash required.

## 16. Engineering Post-Mortem — What Went Wrong & Fixes

1. **EMI-Induced I²C Bus Hangs**
   - *Problem:* Brushed motor switching noise coupled onto the I²C SDA/SCL lines, causing `smbus2` to freeze mid-read.
   - *Fix:* Added 4.7 kΩ pull-up resistors, soldered an RC snubber across the motor terminals, and implemented GPIO `XSHUT` power-cycling logic in Layer 1.

2. **MPU6050 Gyroscope Cumulative Yaw Drift**
   - *Problem:* Sensor heating caused a steady 5°/min gyro drift, leading to corner overshooting.
   - *Fix:* Expanded the UKF state vector in Layer 3 to include a 6th state (b<sub>gyro</sub>) that continuously tracks and subtracts dynamic gyro bias.

3. **OpenCV GIL Thread Bottleneck**
   - *Problem:* High CPU load during color segmentation caused Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) to delay the main control loop.
   - *Fix:* Decoupled vision processing into a dedicated thread updating an asynchronous, lock-free frame queue.

4. **Steering Linkage Mechanical Backlash**
   - *Problem:* Self-tapping M3 screws in the 3D-printed PETG bellcranks loosened over time, introducing 3° of mechanical slop.
   - *Fix:* Redesigned the bellcrank CAD files to incorporate brass heat-set M3 thread inserts, reducing backlash to <0.5°.
