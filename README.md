## 1. Team Introduction

**Team Name:** Byte Riders
**Institution:** CHARUSAT — Charotar University of Science and Technology
**Competition:** World Robot Olympiad 2026, Future Engineers Category

Byte Riders is a two-member engineering team built around a clean split between mechanical and software ownership, developing a fully autonomous, self-driving vehicle for the WRO Future Engineers category. The team's approach centers on a 4-wheel-steering mechanical platform paired with a dual-controller electronics stack — a Raspberry Pi 4B for high-level perception and decision-making, and a dedicated ESP32-S3 for deterministic, real-time actuation — so that vision processing never compromises steering or motor response time.

## 3. Project Overview

Team Byte Riders' vehicle is a fully autonomous, self-driving robot built for the WRO 2026 Future Engineers category. The car must complete the **Open Challenge** (three laps of an unknown, randomly-configured track using wall/edge sensing) and the **Obstacle Challenge** (three laps while dynamically detecting and avoiding red/green traffic pillars, then performing precision parking) with zero human intervention after the start signal.

### Design Philosophy
The vehicle uses a **camera-based perception system** running on a Raspberry Pi 4B for high-level decision-making (pillar color and parking-block detection), paired with a dedicated **ESP32-S3 real-time controller** that closes the low-level steering/motor control loop independently of the vision pipeline's frame rate. This split-brain architecture keeps actuator response deterministic (100 Hz) even while the Pi is busy processing camera frames.

### Key Design Choices
- **4-Wheel Steering (4WS)** using Ackermann steering geometry on both axles, for a significantly tighter turning radius than front-wheel steering — important given the tight corners on a WRO Future Engineers arena.
- **Sensor fusion** of a monocular camera (OpenCV, color-based pillar/parking detection), three Time-of-Flight distance sensors (front/left/right), and a 6-DoF IMU for heading correction and drift compensation.
- **Deterministic actuator control:** the Pi streams high-level commands to the ESP32-S3 over a binary, CRC8-checked serial protocol at 100 Hz, so steering/motor response is never blocked by vision-processing latency.

---

## 4. Mobility Management — Mechanical Design

### Steering
The vehicle uses a **4-Wheel Steering (4WS) system based on Ackermann steering theory**, applied symmetrically to the front and rear axles. Unlike a standard front-wheel-steering (FWS) layout, 4WS lets the rear wheels counter-steer relative to the front, which:
- Shrinks the turning radius substantially (see [Section 8](#8-engineering-specifications) — **~44.9% smaller than an equivalent FWS layout**).
- Improves cornering stability on tight track segments.

### Drivetrain
- **Drive motor:** Johnson-type geared DC motor, **300 RPM**, driven through an **L298N** dual H-bridge driver (`ENA` → speed/PWM, `IN1`/`IN2` → direction). This RPM class was selected to balance top speed against the torque needed for quick direction/heading corrections on a compact 4WS chassis.
- **Measured steering range:** **35°–40°** at the wheel, matching the ±35° design target in the specification table below.
- **Chassis material:** PETG with 30% gyroid infill, chosen for isotropic stiffness and heat resistance (T<sub>g</sub> ≈ 80 °C).

<!-- Add chassis/steering assembly renders or photos here -->

## 5. Power & Sense Management — Electronics

### High-Level Sensing (Raspberry Pi 4B)
- **Pi Camera v2** — OpenCV-based red/green pillar detection and magenta parking-block detection.
- **VL53L1X** Front ToF — I²C address `0x30`, `XSHUT` on GPIO 22.
- **VL53L0X** Left ToF — I²C address `0x31`, `XSHUT` on GPIO 17.
- **VL53L0X** Right ToF — I²C address `0x32`, `XSHUT` on GPIO 27.
- **MPU6050** 6-DoF IMU — I²C address `0x68`.

### Inter-Processor Link
The Raspberry Pi 4B communicates with the ESP32-S3 over **USB serial**, using a **10-byte, CRC8-checked binary packet streamed at 100 Hz**. This keeps the safety-critical steering/motor loop running on dedicated real-time hardware, decoupled from the Pi's variable-latency vision pipeline.

### Real-Time Actuation (ESP32-S3)
- **MG995 servo** — 4WS steering actuator, GPIO 18, 50 Hz PWM.
- **L298N `ENA`** — motor speed control, GPIO 19, PWM.
- **L298N `IN1`** — direction control, GPIO 20.
- **L298N `IN2`** — direction control, GPIO 21.

### Power Rails

## 6. Obstacle Management — Software & Control

### Perception
- **Color-based pillar detection (OpenCV):** HSV thresholding identifies red and green pillars in the camera frame; the robot passes red pillars on the right and green pillars on the left.
- **Magenta parking-block detection:** a dedicated HSV mask locates the parking-lot marker for the precision-parking maneuver at the end of each run.
- **ToF wall-following:** the left/right VL53L0X sensors maintain a target offset from the inner wall; the front VL53L1X sensor triggers corner/obstacle response.
- **IMU heading correction:** the MPU6050 supplies yaw-rate data used to correct for drift between vision updates and to execute clean, repeatable turns.

### Control Loop
- **Control loop rate:** 100 Hz on the ESP32-S3 (5× the ~10 Hz mechanical bandwidth of the servo/motor).
- **Serial link:** 115,200 baud, <9% UART utilization at the 100 Hz packet rate — comfortable headroom for retries/CRC handling.

<!-- Add the specific control algorithm (state machine / PID / pure-pursuit), tuning constants, parking trigger logic,
     and calibration routine details here once available — this section carries the most weight for the Obstacle Challenge score. -->
